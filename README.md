# Deimos Launcher
Welcome to my personal game launcher!

## What's it do?
I plan to have it keep users up to date on Bound, and future games!
Having features like:
 - Downloading games from the launcher
 - Including patching them!

It won't be anything super fancy, but something that works!

## Before use
This project is incomplete and doesn't function, the plan is to start work on launching applicatons from a directory (which it does) and then head into downloading said "game"


## License jibber-jabber!
This project will be licensed under MIT :D
